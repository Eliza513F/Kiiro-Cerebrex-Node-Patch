This is a mod I made for Rimworld that allows Kiiros to wear the Cerebrex Node item, which can be acquired in the Odyssey ending 

To use this mod, if you have Rimworld on Steam, go to the Steam workshop page for it (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3558344165) and click Subscribe, then activate it in a mod manager or in-game. Alternatively, you can download this mod from here, place the mod folder into the Mods folder of Rimworld (See: https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Modding_Tutorials/Mod_Folder_Structure#RimWorld_Mod_Folder for default locations), and then activate it in a mod manager or in-game.
